## This is the future, where's my email Jetpack damnit?!

It's hard to think of a technology which has changed so little since it's inception.

Despite being used by such a large number of people daily, email hasn't conceptually changed since it's inception in the 60's. We're still basically just sending text messages 

The main innovation to email in recent days doens't come from making it easier to use or streamlining the processes involved but instead revolving around advancements to notifications and the email everywhere movement.

I don't know about you, but I want to spend less time being destracted by and writing email not more! Giving the increasing number of things email is being used for, the rising number of emails we're each receiving and having to deal with makes this daily grind unsustainable. This neverending stream of notifications from my digital self, devliered in the most useless manner possible, automated and otherwise are just becoming this noisy mass of things I don't want to deal with. The email I do need to deal with however, I find it can be hard to keep ontop of, either because I end up first reading the email when I can't directly deal with it or it's just something that needs to absorbed into knowledge base for later reference.
