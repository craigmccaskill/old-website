##Optimization

One of the most common pieces of advice you hear when looking into page optimization is to define clear calls to action and place them prominantly. I'd rather take a step further back from this and instead ask what are your users doing *now*. It's all well and good trying to optimize -- but if you don't have any way to meaningfully track what's happening before and after any changes you've made then you're really just guessing. 

This is good advice generally, but the real big win in any kind of optimization is being able to quantatively measure exactly how successful (or not) it was. 

##Analytics are king

Working hour vs. non working hour -- are they browsing from work or home? What can we take from this browsing pattern to improve conversion rates.
